# Hack to override some of Lagom's defaults

# ConductR's config file loading logic will load this file with a higher
# priority than reference.conf, but a lower priority than application.conf.
# That allows ConductR to override Lagom's reference.conf (which can't happen
# from in ConductR's own reference.conf), but still allow users to override
# ConductR's settings in their application.conf.


# Custom ConductR Application loader to load ConductR related configurations
